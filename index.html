                <p>
                I like to wander in video games and stop for a minute every now and then to just think about how the different 
                mechanics in the game is probably written and mainly what is the logical structure behind that. And if I think I am close to the answer 
                I get really excited that if I learn the language and the process of creating, one day I will be able to recreate them myself for anything
                that I desire to build.
                </p>
                <p>
                As much as I like video games I often love to wander around nature and experience every aspect of it, whether it is icy mountains or 
                sunny beaches. When I do that I like to think about life, and I often got to the conclusion that in the same time, life is really simple and incredibly complex.
                I believe it can be translated to computer science as well, because what you as an user see is simple, and really in the background it is just 
                ones and zeros, but between the binary state and the UX there is a complex design that takes a deep knowledge to understand which is really beautiful.

                <h3>Logic Gates</h3>
                <p>It is an idealized or physical device implementing a Boolean function; that is, 
                it performs a logical operation on one or more binary inputs and produces a single binary output.</p>
                <h3>ASCII</h3>
                <p>It stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. 
                Computers can only understand numbers, so it is the numerical representation of a character such as 'a' or '@' or an action of some sort.</p>
                <h3>RAM - Randomly Accessed Memory</h3>
                <p>It is a form of computer data storage which stores frequently used program instructions to increase the general speed of a system. It can be randomly accessed. 
                Data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory.</p>
                <h3>Programming Language</h3>
                <p>A formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output. 
                They generally consist of instructions for a computer and can be used to create programs that implement specific algorithms.</p>
                <h3>Domain Name System</h3>
                <p>A hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network. 
                It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities.</p>
                <h3>HTTP - HyperText Transfer Protocol</h3>
                <p>An application protocol for distributed, collaborative, and hypermedia information systems. It is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web. 
                It is the standard protocol to exchange or transfer hypertext.</p>
